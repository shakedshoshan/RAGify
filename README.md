# RAGify - Automated RAG-as-a-Service Platform

## Project Overview

RAGify is a platform designed to simplify and automate the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures. By providing an intuitive user interface, RAGify removes the technical barriers to entry, allowing users to transform their private data into a powerful, conversational API with just a few clicks.

The platform handles the entire RAG pipeline automatically: from data ingestion and processing to vector embedding and API generation. The result is a dedicated, ready-to-use API endpoint that can be integrated into any application, enabling powerful, context-aware AI interactions.

## Key Features

### User & Project Management
A dedicated user dashboard to manage multiple RAG projects, view usage statistics, and access unique API keys.

### Diverse Data Ingestion
Easily upload files (PDF, CSV, TXT), crawl websites via URL, integrate with external APIs (e.g., Notion, Slack), or simply paste text directly into the platform.

### Custom Persona Configuration
Define the "personality" of your RAG model, including its tone, response style, and specific instructions, to ensure a tailored user experience.

### Automated Backend Pipeline
The system automatically handles the complex backend processes:

- **Parsing & Chunking**: Breaking down raw data into manageable, relevant text chunks.
- **Embedding**: Converting each chunk into a numerical vector using a state-of-the-art embedding model.
- **Vector Database Storage**: Storing vectors in a dedicated, high-performance vector database for efficient semantic search.

### Instant API Generation
Upon completion of the data processing, a unique API endpoint and key are automatically generated for immediate use.

### Comprehensive API Usage
The platform provides example code in multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.) to demonstrate how to query the generated API. The API handles the entire RAG workflow, from vector search to LLM response generation.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: NestJS (TypeScript)
- **API**: RESTful API for all platform functionalities.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Built with React, Next.js, or Vue.js to provide a modern and responsive user interface.

### Databases
- **Standard Database**: FireStore for managing user accounts, project metadata, and API keys.
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone, Weaviate, or ChromaDB for efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings.

### Cloud Infrastructure
- **Provider**: AWS
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform is used to provision and manage the entire cloud environment, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

### Models
- **LLMs & Embedding Models**: Integration with various large language models and embedding models, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Hugging Face.

## Getting Started

To get started with RAGify, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RAGify.git
cd RAGify
```

### 2. Set up the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
Configure your environment variables (database connection strings, API keys, etc.).

### 3. Set up the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies.
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Launch the Application
Start both the backend and frontend servers.
